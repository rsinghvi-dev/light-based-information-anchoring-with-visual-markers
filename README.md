Background (Given):
A thermal camera is a contactless device that detects infrared energy and converts it into an
image, capable of detecting tiny differences in temperature and see through darkness or smoke. 
One of the application of thermal camera is in public safety; firefighters use thermal cameras 
to see the heat signature of visually obscured victims. Firefighters use these cameras to search for
spot smoldering fires inside a wall, or detect overheated electrical wiring. These cameras are
susceptible to the malicious attacks however. Theoretically any attack that is feasible on visual
cameras could be launched on thermal cameras as well. People with malicious intent could attack
the thermal camera feed and modify the images to attack safety critical applications.


Motivation:


Design Goals:
Test the efficacy of conventional visual attacks on thermal cameras, and to assess security of
thermal cameras in public safety applications.


Deliverables:
-Calibrate thermal cameras
-Research visual attacks on light cameras and map those attacks to thermal cameras
-Implement image processing techniques to launch visual attacks
-Quantify the stealthiness of these attacks
